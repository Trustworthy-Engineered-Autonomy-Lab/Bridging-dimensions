# Bridging-dimensions
These are two case studies for the paper "bridging dimensions: confident reachability for high-dimensional controllers"

1. Train the LDC first and gather the training data (also contains the ground truth for safety verification) in the three py files, “Mountain_car_simulaiton.py, Train_HDC.py, train_test_LDC.py”. For the first training, we only aim to decrease the MSE as much as we can. If there is a high overapproximation error in the verification before inflation, we switch to the verification-oriented KD method to retrain the LDC by balancing the MSE and Lipschitz constants. “https://github.com/JmfanBU/ReachNNStar/tree/master/VF_retraining”
2. After getting the action-based discrepancy, we try to inflate the interval in the Taylor model in POLAR. Concerning the trajectory-based discrepancy, we extracted the reachable tube (a sequence of polygons) and inflate it with the trajectory-based discrepancy. With respect to the action-based discrepancy, we inflate the interval by action-based discrepancy from the Taylor model. This process involves inserting the CP table, picking up the correct CP value in different initial set or state space, and so on.
